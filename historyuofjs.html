                <h2 style="text-align: center;"> HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT ( JS.)</h2>
                <p>In 1995 a man named Bredan Eich, while working at Netscape Communications Corporation Developed JAVASCRIPT</p>
                <p>
                    It was originally designed to add interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. 
                    Since its creation, JavaScript has become one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages, 
                    especially in building web applications and websites. Over the years, 
                    JavaScript has evolved and continues to be a key technology in the world of web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript was originally named MOCHA,
                     then later LIVESCRIPT, before finally settling on JavaScript. 
                     In 1997, the ECMAScript standard was created to standardize the language, 
                    and JavaScript has since been based on this standard.
                </p>
                <P>
                    In the early 2000s, 
                    AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was introduced, 
                    allowing for more dynamic and responsive web applications. 
                    This opened up new possibilities for creating interactive and seamless user experiences on the web.
                </P>
                <P>
                    In recent years, with the rise of frameworks and libraries such as Angular, React, and Vue.js, 
                    JavaScript has become even more powerful and versatile. 
                    These tools have made it easier for developers to build complex web applications and improve the overall user experience.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Today, JavaScript is used not only in web development but also in mobile app development, server-side programming, 
                    and even in emerging technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and virtual reality. 
                    As technology continues to evolve,
                     JavaScript will likely remain a vital tool for developers in creating innovative and engaging digital experiences.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">TRACING THE HISTORY OF JS. FROM ECMAScript 1 TO ECMAScript 6</h1>
                <h2>ECMAScript 1 (ES1)</h2>
                <p>
                    ES1 was the first standardized version of JavaScript in 1997.
                    It laid the foundation for the language syntax and basic features.
                </p>
                <h2>ECMAScript 2 (ES2) and ECMAScript 3 (ES3)</h2>
                <p>
                    These versions introduced minor updates and improvements to the language.
                    ES3, released in 1999, brought significant changes and added features like try/catch exception handling.
                </p>
                <h2>ECMAScript 4 (ES4)</h2>
                <p>
                    ES4 was a major update with ambitious changes proposed, including classes, interfaces, and packages.
                    Due to disagreements within the community, ES4 was abandoned, 
                    leading to a shift in approach to smaller, incremental updates.
                </p>
                <h2>ECMAScript 5 (ES5)</h2>
                <p>
                    Released in 2009, ES5 focused on adding new features and enhancing existing functionality.
                    It introduced strict mode, JSON support, Array methods (e.g., forEach, map, filter), and more.
                </p>
                <h2>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) (also known as ECMAScript 2015)</h2>
                <p>
                    ES6, released in 2015, was a significant milestone in the evolution of JavaScript.
                    It introduced major features like let and const for variable declarations, arrow functions, classes, modules, destructuring assignment, and more.
                    ES6 aimed to make JavaScript more expressive, maintainable, and easier to work with for developers.
                    These updates and additions in each version of ECMAScript have played a crucial role in shaping modern JavaScript and
                    making it a versatile, powerful, and widely used programming language. Subsequent versions after ES4 have continued to build on this foundation, 
                    introducing new features and improvements to further enhance the language.
